## Using the plugin (Version 1)
- Open the tokens menu (inside admin button on bottom bar)
- Create token/s
- Input fields to specify token rules. Tokens will only activate once a necessary field (e.g. CampaignID, ObjectID, ContractAddress) are filled in.
- Try it out with vatoms from your wallet. You can get the necessary details for your vatoms by opening your wallet -> clicking on a vatom -> clicking on the three dots in top right -> click on general info -> all necessary info should be there
- Can delete token if/when necessary.
- Can specify settings such as multi-condition or time/date restriction
- You can add a token gating component to zone objects. This will allow gating that specific zone. Will have same UI as standard token-gating panel.
- You can save and load your token rules via the buttons at the bottom of the panel.

**Note** Admins by design. Will bypass all entry denial. A popup will be displayed to notify user of this. <br />
**Note** The API query might take few seconds to return before granting or denying entrance to space.
